# khalili🌙

> A modern, mobile-first spiritual companion designed to help Muslims track prayers, build consistency, and find spiritual balance through data-driven insights and social accountability.


## 📖 About The Project

**khalili** is not just another prayer time app. It is a holistic dashboard designed to improve the *quality* (Khushu) of your worship, not just the quantity. By combining habit-tracking psychology with Islamic principles, it helps users identify barriers to prayer, track their spiritual heart state, and stay accountable with friends and family via the **Rakib System**.

Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, it features a beautiful, minimalist UI optimized for mobile devices.
